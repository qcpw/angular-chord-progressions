## Progression Generator

### Generate Simple Chord Progressions

This application generates chord progressions, based on the idea that each chord has a set of other chords that can logically follow it. For example, the "V" chord is usually followed by the "I".

This, of course, does not account for the true complexity of music. There are many valid progressions that will not be generated. For example, there is no modulation, and many valid chord substitutions are excluded from the generation procedure.
